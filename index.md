# Hello World!

This is Gene1974(Yingzhuo Huang). I'm a graduate major in Electronic Engineering(EE).

I'm looking forward to being a real programmer. So I'm writing the blog to record my learning process.

I want to learn Java, JavaScript, Go, PHP, Spring, Django, Vue, Unity and so on. I'd appreciate it if you could help me or teach me.

Welcome to my page.
